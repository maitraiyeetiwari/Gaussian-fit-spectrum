Fitting a gaussian to a spectrum

Here, I fit a gaussian profile(s) to a CII spectrum using GILDAS software. 


# Code and resources

GILDAS

# Model Building

Running the script in gildas, prompts the user to select the velocity range within which the emission is detected. Once this is done, the code fits a gaussian to the spectrum. 
ngc197*.greg is the file with one gaussian fit.
